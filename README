Summary
=======
This is a persistent sha1 package, based on shamodule.c from python 2.4.6.

Purpose
=======
The built-in hashlib.sha1 in python is a wrapper around a C library, which does 
not support persistence.

There are some pure sha1 implementations support persistence, like:

    http://force.vnsecurity.net/download/rd/sha.py
    or
    http://code.google.com/p/slowsha/

The problem is that they are too slow than hashlib.sha1 to be used in production
environment.

This package adapts from the C sha1 module from python 2.4.6, add two methods: 
dumps and loads. So, the performance is the same as python's one, and we can 
save and restore the status at anytime. The dumped string is small(108 bytes).

Installation
============
To install:

    python setup.py build
    sudo python setup.py install

Example
=======
    import persistentsha1
    h1 = persistentsha1.sha1()
    h1.update("test")
    s = h1.dumps()
    h2 = persistentsha1.loads(s)
    assert h1.hexdigest() == h2.hexdigest()
